# Keybindings And Whichkey.nvim

In this blog I show you how to use some keybindings and a plugin called `whichkey.nvim` using Lua. To get started you need to create a folder called `keybindings` in the `lua` folder and a file called `init.lua` inside it:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/lua/keybindings
nvim !$/init.lua
```

This will create a folder and open the file in neovim.

Paste these keybindings into the file:

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = ' ' -- Change the leader key from ctrl+\ to only space

local map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap

-- For moving between different splits you can use c-h c-j c-k c-l
map('n', '<C-h>', '<C-w>h', {noremap = true, silent = false})
map('n', '<C-l>', '<C-w>l', {noremap = true, silent = false})
map('n', '<C-j>', '<C-w>j', {noremap = true, silent = false})
map('n', '<C-k>', '<C-w>k', {noremap = true, silent = false})

-- Map jk or kj to escape in insert mode
map('i', 'jk', '<ESC>', {noremap = true, silent = false})
map('i', 'kj', '<ESC>', {noremap = true, silent = false})

-- Makes indentation better
map('v', '<', '<gv', {noremap = true, silent = false})
map('v', '>', '>gv', {noremap = true, silent = false})
```

Now these keybindings have been added. You need to require this file inside your main `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file:

```lua
require('keybindings')
```

Done! You can try these keybindings in your neovim now. 

But wait! There's more!

You can use a plugin called `which-key.nvim` to show a popup from the bottom of the screen whenever you press the leader(space) key.

To install it, add this to your packer startup `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua`:

```lua
use 'folke/which-key.nvim'
```

After you have done that, restart neovim and run `:PackerSync` to install the plugin and update the existing ones.

Now we need to create a config folder for `whichkey`:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/lua/whichkey-config
nvim !$/init.lua
```

Add this configuration in the file:

```lua
local wk = require("which-key")
local mappings = {
  q = {":q<cr>", "Quit"},
  Q = {":wq<cr>", "Save & Quit"},
  w = {":w<cr>", "Save"},
  x = {":bdelete<cr>", "Close"},
  e = {':NvimTreeToggle', "Nvim Tree"}
  E = {":e ~/.config/nvim/init.lua", "Edit config"}
}
local opts = {prefix = '<leader>'}
wk.register(mappings, opts)
```

Again, we need to require this file in our `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`:

```lua
require('whichkey-config')
```

Now you can press the spacebar and you will see a bunch of options at the bottom of the screen.

And that's it! You have successfully setup some basic keybindings and `which-key.nvim`
