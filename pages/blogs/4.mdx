# Installing nvim-tree.lua

In this blog you will see how you can use a plugin called `nvim-tree.lua`. It is a file explorer for neovim written in lua.

## Install using packer.nvim

Go to your `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/init.lu` file and then add this inside the packer startup function:

```lua
use {'kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua', requires = 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons'}
```

Then restart neovim and then do `:PackerSync`. This command will install the plugin and update existing ones.

# Configuring the plugin

So we have installed the plugin. Now we need to configure it. First let's make a configuration folder for nvim-tree and also an `init.lua` file inside it.

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/lua/nvimtree-config
nvim !$/init.lua
```

Now you can paste the configuration in the file:

```lua
vim.g.nvim_tree_width = 25
vim.g.nvim_tree_indent_markers = 1
require'nvim-tree'.setup {auto_open = 1, auto_close = 1, gitignore = 1}
vim.cmd('nnoremap <space>e :NvimTreeToggle<CR>')
```

To run the file whenever neovim is opened, we have to add this in our `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file:

```lua
require('nvimtree-config')
```

After saving the file, you can restart neovim and if you press space+e, you will see a nice file tree open at the left side of your window
And that's it! You have successfully added a simple file explorer to neovim using lua!
