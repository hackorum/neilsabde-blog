# Using telescope.nvim for fuzzy finding

In this blog I show you how you can use a plugin called `telescope.nvim` for fuzzy finding files, buffers, old files, text and so on...

**Make sure you have installed rg or ripgrep on your system**

First we need to install the plugin using `packer.nvim`. Add this to your packer startup function:

```lua
use 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
```

Now restart neovim and run `:PackerSync`. This will install the plugin and update existing plugins.

After the plugin has been installed, you need to add some configuration for it. To do that, we need to create a folder called `telescope-config` inside our `lua` folder:

```bash
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/lua/telescope-config
nvim !$/init.lua
```

This will open the `init.lua` file in neovim. Here you can paste the following config:

```lua
local actions = require('telescope.actions')
require('telescope').setup {
    defaults = {
        layout_config = {
          width = 0.75,
          prompt_position = "top",
          preview_cutoff = 120,
          horizontal = {mirror = false},
          vertical = {mirror = false},
        },
        find_command = {'rg', '--no-heading', '--with-filename', '--line-number', '--column', '--smart-case'},
        prompt_prefix = "? ",
        selection_caret = "? ",
        entry_prefix = "  ",
        initial_mode = "insert",
        selection_strategy = "reset",
        sorting_strategy = "descending",
        layout_strategy = "horizontal",
        file_sorter = require'telescope.sorters'.get_fuzzy_file,
        file_ignore_patterns = {},
        generic_sorter =require'telescope.sorters'.get_generic_fuzzy_sorter,
        path_display = {},
        winblend = 0,
        border = {},
        borderchars = {'?', '?', '?', '?', '?', '?', '?', '?'},
        color_devicons = true,
        use_less = true,
        set_env = {['COLORTERM'] = 'truecolor'}, -- default = nil,
        file_previewer = require'telescope.previewers'.vim_buffer_cat.new,
        grep_previewer = require'telescope.previewers'.vim_buffer_vimgrep.new,
        qflist_previewer = require'telescope.previewers'.vim_buffer_qflist.new,
        buffer_previewer_maker = require'telescope.previewers'.buffer_previewer_maker,
        mappings = {
            i = {
                ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next,
                ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous,
                ["<C-q>"] = actions.smart_send_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
                ["<esc>"] = actions.close,
                ["<CR>"] = actions.select_default + actions.center
            },
            n = {
                ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next,
                ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous,
                ["<C-q>"] = actions.smart_send_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is some configuration for the window position, borders and some keybindings.

You will also need to require this configuration in your main `init.lua`:

```lua
require('telescope-config')
```

## Some useful commands

You can try the following commands:

* `:Telescope find_files` This will open a list of files in the cwd(current working directory) or in simple terms, current folder

* `:Telescope live_grep` This command will return any files that have the current search query

* `:Telescope buffers` This command will open a list of all open buffers

* `:Telescope oldfiles` This command will open a list of recently opened files

## Discovering new commands

You can find other commands by pressing `:Telescop` and it will open a list of all the available commands.

## Helpful which key keybindings

Add this in your telescope mappings table for some useful keybindings:

```lua
f = {
    name = "Telescope",
    f = {"<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>", "Find Files"},
    r = {"<cmd>Telescope live_grep<cr>", "Live Grep"},
    b = {"<cmd>Telescope buffers<cr>", "Buffers"},
    o = {"<cmd>Telescope oldfiles<cr>", "Recent Files"}
  }
```

And that's it! You have succesfully setup telescope and some keybindings to quickly navigate through files!
